**Source-available AI knowledge management platform for privacy-focused professionals**

A powerful local-first AI document intelligence platform that brings enterprise-grade semantic search and AI processing directly to your Mac. Built for professionals who need advanced AI capabilities without sacrificing privacy or data security.

## What This AI Knowledge Management Software Does

We created this privacy-focused AI platform because existing cloud-based AI tools compromise data security by sending sensitive information to remote servers. Sefirot Intelligence Platform runs entirely on your Mac, providing sophisticated semantic search, document analysis, and AI assistance while keeping your private data completely under your control.

**Core Philosophy**: Your documents remain on your device. AI processing happens locally. You maintain complete control over what information (if any) gets sent to external AI services.

## Advanced Local AI Processing Features

- **ChromaDB Vector Database Integration** - Enterprise-grade semantic search across unlimited documents
- **3-Tier Privacy Classification System** - Automatic content categorization with user control over AI access
- **Professional Electron GUI Installer** - Streamlined setup process with real-time progress tracking  
- **Obsidian Knowledge Management Integration** - Visual document organization with AI-enhanced linking
- **Hardware-Adaptive Performance** - Optimized processing for Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 and Intel Macs
- **Multi-Device Environment Sync** - Secure credential sharing without cloud dependency
- **Offline-First AI Processing** - Full functionality without internet connection
- **Self-Hosted Document Intelligence** - No data leaves your device unless explicitly permitted

## Quick Installation Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentic-lab-environment
cd agentic-lab-environment
npm install
npm start
```

Our professional GUI installer provides automated setup for:
1. **System Requirements Validation** - Automatic macOS and hardware compatibility checking
2. **API Credential Configuration** - Secure setup for Anthropic Claude Pro + OpenAI services  
3. **Python AI Environment Creation** - Automated installation of ChromaDB, transformers, and ML libraries
4. **Obsidian Knowledge Vault Setup** - Pre-configured vault with AI-ready templates and plugins
5. **Interactive Platform Tour** - Guided walkthrough of semantic search and AI processing capabilities

## Why We Built This Private AI Platform

After years of professionals being forced to choose between AI capabilities and data privacy, we recognized the need for a local-first AI knowledge management solution that delivers:

- **Complete Local AI Processing** - All document analysis and semantic search happens on your device
- **Granular Privacy Controls** - Cloud API usage only when explicitly permitted by user
- **Universal Semantic Search** - ChromaDB-powered intelligent search across entire document collections
- **Zero Workflow Disruption** - Works with existing file organization and knowledge management systems

Our innovative privacy tier system enables precise control: personal documents stay completely local, business documents get limited cloud access when beneficial, and public information can leverage any AI service you choose.

This approach solves the fundamental privacy vs. capability dilemma facing knowledge workers who need advanced AI document processing without compromising sensitive information security.

## System Requirements for AI Knowledge Management Platform

- **macOS 12.0 Monterey or later** (Universal support for Intel x64 and Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3)
- **8GB+ RAM minimum** (16GB+ recommended for processing large document collections)
- **10GB+ available storage** (additional space needed for document processing and vector database)
- **AI Service API Keys**: Anthropic Claude Pro (required), OpenAI API (required), optional services available

## Technical Architecture

**Cross-Platform Frontend**: Professional Electron application with native macOS GUI installer  
**AI Processing Backend**: Python 3.11 with Conda environment management for ML/AI libraries  
**Vector Database**: ChromaDB integration for high-performance local semantic search and storage  
**Knowledge Management**: Obsidian integration with custom vault structure and AI-enhanced plugins  
**Privacy Framework**: Advanced 3-tier document classification system with granular user control  
**Hardware Optimization**: Adaptive performance tuning for Apple Silicon and Intel Mac architectures
